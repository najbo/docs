# Resizer

## Introduction

October CMS ships with an image resizer that lets you change the shape and size of supported images.

## Resize a File on Disk

To resize an image, use the `open` method on the `Resizer` facade to target a file path.

```php
$image = Resizer::open('path/to/image.jpg');
```

You may also pass an uploaded file from the [page request input](./request-input.md).

```php
$image = Resizer::open(Input::file('field_name'));
```

To resize the image, call the `resize` method on the object to perform the resize. The first argument is the image width, the second argument is the image height and the third argument is an array of resize parameters.

```php
$image->resize(800, 600, ['mode' => 'crop']);
```

The width and height arguments are also optional, for example, to use the existing width and only adjust the height, pass the second argument as `null`. This value is then calculated using original image ratio (automatic proportional scaling) based on the `mode` option.

```php
$image->resize(800, null, [...]);
```

Finally, use the `save` method to save the resized image to a new location.

```php
$image->save('path/to/new/file.jpg');
```

### Resize Parameters

The following elements are supported in the options array are supported:

Key | Description | Default | Options
--- | --- | --- | ---
`mode` | How the image should be fitted to dimensions | `auto` | `exact`, `portrait`, `landscape`, `auto`, `fit`, or `crop`
`offset` | Offset the crop of the resized image | `[0,0]` | [left, top]
`quality` | Quality of the resized image | `90` | `0-100`
`sharpen` | Amount to sharpen the image | `0` | `0-100`

### Available Modes

The `mode` option allows you to specify how the image should be resized. The available modes are as follows:

Mode | Description
--- | ---
`auto` | Automatically choose between `portrait` and `landscape` based on the image's orientation
`exact` | Resize to the exact dimensions given, without preserving aspect ratio
`portrait` | Resize to the given height and adapt the width to preserve aspect ratio
`landscape` | Resize to the given width and adapt the height to preserve aspect ratio
`crop` | Crop to the given dimensions after fitting as much of the image as possible inside those
`fit` | Fit the image inside the given maximal dimensions, keeping the aspect ratio

## Resize a File to Browser

The `System\Classes\ResizeImages` class can be used to resize an image and serve it via a URL:

```php
$url = \System\Classes\ResizeImages::resize($image, $width, $height, $options);
```

If you are resizing a media library item, you should resolve the media path using the `Media\Classes\MediaLibrary` class and `url` method.

```php
$image = \Media\Classes\MediaLibrary::url('relative/path/to/asset.jpg');

$url = \System\Classes\ResizeImages::resize($image, $width, $height, $options);
```

::: tip
There is also a `|resize` [markup filter](../../markup/filter/resize.md) that can be used for resizing images in your themes.
