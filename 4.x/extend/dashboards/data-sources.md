# Data Sources

## Creating Data Sources

Every plugin can register any number of data sources. It is recommended to create a new data source for each type of data provided by a plugin. For example, if a plugin offers both customer and sales data, having two separate data sources would simplify widget configuration for end users.

Data sources are classes that extend the `Backend\Classes\ReportDataSourceBase` class. Each data source must register at least one metric and one dimension. In addition, data source classes must implement the `fetchData` method, which is required to return the `ReportFetchDataResult` object. In most cases, when your data source fetches data from the database, you can use the `ReportDataQueryBuilder` class, which constructs and executes the database queries based on the dimension and metrics configuration.

```php
use Db;
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Backend\Classes\ReportMetric;
use Backend\Classes\ReportDimension;
use Backend\Classes\ReportDimensionField;
use Backend\Classes\ReportDataSourceBase;
use Backend\Classes\ReportFetchDataResult;
use Backend\Classes\ReportDataOrderRule;
use Backend\Classes\ReportDataPaginationParams;
use Backend\Classes\ReportDataQueryBuilder;

class MyReportDataSource extends ReportDataSourceBase
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        // Register dimensions and metrics here
    }

    protected function fetchData(
        ReportDimension $dimension,
        array $metrics,
        array $metricsConfiguration,
        ?Carbon $startDate,
        ?Carbon $endDate,
        ?int $startTimestamp,
        array $dimensionFilters,
        ?string $groupInterval,
        ?ReportDataOrderRule $orderRule,
        ?int $limit,
        ?ReportDataPaginationParams $paginationParams,
        bool $hideEmptyDimensionValues,
        bool $totalsOnly
    ): ReportFetchDataResult
    {
        // Construct and return a ReportFetchDataResult object,
        // or use the ReportDataQueryBuilder class to do the hard work.
    }
}
```

Plugins must register their data sources in the Plugin Registration file (Plugin.php), within the `boot` method.

```php
use Backend\Classes\ReportDataSourceManager;

public function boot()
{
    ReportDataSourceManager::instance()->registerDataSourceClass(
        MyReportDataSource::class,
        'My Custom Data Source' // This can be a reference to a localization string
    );
}
```

We will use a simple ecommerce plugin database structure for the documentation examples. The plugin includes the following tables.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/data-source-data-structure.png)

We'll create a data source to display sales data for products and categories in the form of a table, graph, and indicator.

### Registering Dimensions

Data sources must register their metrics and dimensions in the constructor. Use the `registerDimension` method to register a dimension. Let's begin by registering the product dimension for our e-commerce plugin example.

```php
const DIMENSION_PRODUCT = 'product';

public function __construct()
{
    $this->registerDimension(new ReportDimension(
        self::DIMENSION_PRODUCT,
        'acme_shop_products.id',
        'Product',
        'product_name'
    ));
}
```

The `registerDimension` method accepts a `ReportDimension` object. The constructor for `ReportDimension` takes the following arguments:

- `string $code` - specifies the dimension referral code. Your data source will use this code to distinguish the dimension in the `fetchData` calls. It can be a simple string, for example, “city”.
- `string $databaseColumnName` - specifies the dimension column name in the data source table. The column name is used in `ReportDataQueryBuilder` to construct database queries. Including the table name (`acme_shop_products` in this case) along with the column name is often necessary to avoid ambiguity when the data source query includes multiple tables. If your data source is not database-driven, any value can be used for this argument. In most instances, the dimension column corresponds to the primary key in the dimension table.
- `string $displayName` -  specifies the dimension name used in reports. For example, in the Table widget, this could become the title of the dimension column. It is also used in the widget configuration popup, in the dimension dropdown. The value for this argument can be a static string, or a reference to a localization string.
- `?string $labelColumnName` -  specifies the name of the column for the dimension label. Use this column to provide a user-friendly label for the dimension. If this argument is not provided, the value of `$databaseColumnName` is used as the dimension label. Keep in mind that widget dimension sorting and filters will utilize the dimension label value when the label column name provided.

The `registerDimension` method returns the registered dimension object, allowing for chaining.

After registering the data source and dimension, you should be able to view them in the dashboard widget configurator.

### Registering Metrics

We can register two metrics associated with products: sale amount and quantity. These metrics are registered using the `registerMetric` method of the data source class.

```php
const METRIC_TOTAL_AMOUNT = 'total_amount';
const METRIC_TOTAL_QUANTITY = 'total_quantity';

public function __construct()
{
    ...

    $this->registerMetric(new ReportMetric(
        self::METRIC_TOTAL_AMOUNT,
        'acme_shop_sales.total',
        'Total amount',
        ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_SUM
    ));

    $this->registerMetric(new ReportMetric(
        self::METRIC_TOTAL_QUANTITY,
        'acme_shop_sales.quantity',
        'Quantity',
        ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_SUM
    ));
}
```

The `registerMetric` method accepts a `ReportMetric` object. The constructor for this class has the following arguments:

- `string $code` - the metric referral code.
- `string $databaseColumnName` - the metric column name. It's always a good idea to provide the table name along with the field name to avoid ambiguity in SQL queries.
- `string $displayName` - the metric name used in reports.
- `string $aggregateFunction` - the aggregate function for the metric. One of the `ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_XXX` constants.
- `?array $intlFormatOptions`  -  client-side formatting options, compatible with the `Intl.NumberFormat()` constructor options argument. Skip the argument to use the default formatting options.

The dashboard can aggregate metric data using one of the following functions:

```php
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_SUM
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_AVG
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_MIN
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_MAX
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_COUNT
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_NONE
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_COUNT_DISTINCT
ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_COUNT_DISTINCT_NOT_NULL
```

For our needs, the `SUM` function is the most suitable as our metrics are the total quantity and amount. Therefore, we use `ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_SUM` in the constructors of both metrics.

After registering the metrics, you can add them to a dashboard widget configuration:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/metrics.png)

### Returning Data from a Data Source

Data sources should implement the `fetchData` method to return data for the requested dimension, metrics, and dimension fields. This method has quite a few arguments, but in most cases, if your data source works with a database, you can pass them directly to the `ReportDataQueryBuilder` class.

The use of the `ReportDataQueryBuilder` class is optional. The sole requirement for the `fetchData` method is to return a `Backend\Classes\ReportFetchDataResult` object. The approach taken to achieve this doesn't matter. If your data source doesn't work with a database, or if you find `ReportDataQueryBuilder` not flexible enough for your needs, you can use native Laravel classes to load the data.

Below is a partial implementation of our demo ecommerce data source:

```php
protected function fetchData(
    ReportDimension $dimension,
    array $metrics,
    array $metricsConfiguration,
    ?Carbon $startDate,
    ?Carbon $endDate,
    ?int $startTimestamp,
    array $dimensionFilters,
    ?string $groupInterval,
    ?ReportDataOrderRule $orderRule,
    ?int $limit,
    ?ReportDataPaginationParams $paginationParams,
    bool $hideEmptyDimensionValues,
    bool $totalsOnly
): ReportFetchDataResult {
    if ($dimension->getCode() !== self::DIMENSION_PRODUCT) {
        throw new SystemException('Invalid dimension');
    }

    $reportQueryBuilder = new ReportDataQueryBuilder(
        'acme_shop_products',
        $dimension,
        $metrics,
        $orderRule,
        $dimensionFilters,
        $limit,
        $paginationParams,
        $groupInterval,
        $hideEmptyDimensionValues,
        $startDate,
        $endDate,
        $startTimestamp,
        'acme_shop_sales.sale_date',
        null,
        $totalsOnly
    );

    ...
}
```

The `ReportDataQueryBuilder` class constructor accepts most of the `fetchData` arguments, with a few additions:

- The first argument is the main table name to be used for fetching data. It's typically the table associated with the requested dimension. In our case, as the dimension is product ID, we use the `acme_shop_products` table as the main query table.
- The constructor also accepts the name of a date column, which is used to limit the returned data to the interval requested by the user. In our case, we will use the sales date column `acme_shop_sales.sale_date`.
- Additionally, the constructor accepts a timestamp column name. Although the default minimum time resolution of the dashboard is one day, some widgets can fetch data for the past hour, enabled by the timestamp column. For simplicity, we are not implementing this feature and will pass `null` as the argument value.

As our metrics belong to a table different from the dimension table, we need to configure the report data query builder object to load the metrics data from the `acme_shop_sales` table. This is achieved using the `onConfigureMetrics` method:

```php
$reportQueryBuilder->onConfigureMetrics(
    function(Builder $query, ReportDimension $dimension, array $metrics) {
        $query->leftJoin('acme_shop_sales', function($join) {
            $join->on('acme_shop_sales.product_id', '=', 'acme_shop_products.id');
        });
    }
);
```

The method accepts a callback function, which must take an `Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder` object, a dimension object, and an array of metrics as arguments. This enables highly customizable implementations. In our simple case, we only use Laravel’s query builder object to join the sales table.

And finally, once the report data query builder is configured, we can execute the queries and return the loaded data:

```php
return $reportQueryBuilder->getFetchDataResult($metricsConfiguration);
```

Below is the full implementation of the `fetchData` method:

```php
protected function fetchData(
    ReportDimension $dimension,
    array $metrics,
    array $metricsConfiguration,
    ?Carbon $startDate,
    ?Carbon $endDate,
    ?int $startTimestamp,
    array $dimensionFilters,
    ?string $groupInterval,
    ?ReportDataOrderRule $orderRule,
    ?int $limit,
    ?ReportDataPaginationParams $paginationParams,
    bool $hideEmptyDimensionValues,
    bool $totalsOnly
): ReportFetchDataResult {
    if ($dimension->getCode() !== self::DIMENSION_PRODUCT) {
        throw new SystemException('Invalid dimension');
    }

    $reportQueryBuilder = new ReportDataQueryBuilder(
        'acme_shop_products',
        $dimension,
        $metrics,
        $orderRule,
        $dimensionFilters,
        $limit,
        $paginationParams,
        $groupInterval,
        $hideEmptyDimensionValues,
        $startDate,
        $endDate,
        $startTimestamp,
        'acme_shop_sales.sale_date',
        null,
        $totalsOnly
    );

    $reportQueryBuilder->onConfigureMetrics(
        function(Builder $query, ReportDimension $dimension, array $metrics) {
            $query->leftJoin('acme_shop_sales', function($join) {
                $join->on('acme_shop_sales.product_id', '=', 'acme_shop_products.id');
            });
        }
    );

    return $reportQueryBuilder->getFetchDataResult($metricsConfiguration);
}
```

This configuration is sufficient to display the data source data in a table widget:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/table-all-data.png)

### Formatting Metrics Data

By default, the dashboard formats metrics data as numbers. If the default formatting is not suitable, you can configure metrics to display data in other formats. In our ecommerce example, it makes sense to display the total amount as currency.

The final parameter of the `ReportMetric` class constructor takes an array of options that are compatible with the `options` argument of [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat), a browser API. The example below demonstrates a configuration ideal for displaying currency in the US format:

```php
$this->registerMetric(new ReportMetric(
    self::METRIC_TOTAL_AMOUNT,
    'acme_shop_sales.total',
    'Total amount',
    ReportMetric::AGGREGATE_SUM,
    [
        'style' => 'currency',
        'currency' => 'USD',
    ]
));
```

The updated metric data is displayed on the dashboard as follows:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/currency.png)

### Displaying Extra Dimension Data

In our demo database structure, the products table has a `brand` column. Additionally, it references the categories table, ensuring each product is linked to a category. We can display the brand and category names in reports along with the product name by using the dimension fields feature.

Dimension fields should be added to a dimension within the data source constructor. The dimension object includes the `addDimensionField` method, accepting a configured dimension field object. Here's how we can add dimension fields for the brand and category names to the product dimension:

```php
$this->registerDimension(new ReportDimension(
    self::DIMENSION_PRODUCT,
    'acme_shop_products.id',
    'Product',
    'product_name'
))->addDimensionField(new ReportDimensionField(
    'oc_field_brand',
    'Brand',
    'brand',
    true,
    true
))->addDimensionField(new ReportDimensionField(
    'oc_field_category',
    'Category',
    'acme_shop_categories.category_name',
    true,
    true
));
```

The `ReportDimensionField` constructor takes these arguments:

- `string $code` - specifies the field referral code. The code must begin with the `oc_field_` prefix.
- `string $displayName` - specifies the field name to use in reports. For example, in the Table widget, this could become the title of the dimension column. It is also used in the widget configuration popup, in the dimension dropdown. The value for this argument can be a static string, or a reference to a localization string.
- `?string $columnName` -  optional database column name for filtering or sorting. Provide the column name to enable sorting and filtering. In most cases, you should specify a value for this argument.
- `bool $sortable` - specifies if the field is sortable.
- `bool $filterable` - specifies if the field is filterable.

After registration, the dimension field will appear in the dashboard widget configurators:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/dimension-fields.png)

The remaining task involves returning data for the dimension fields. Since the `ReportDataQueryBuilder` class does not automate this process, it's necessary to configure its underlying query to add a join and add the corresponding columns to the query. This can be accomplished in the `onConfigureQuery` callback:

```php
$reportQueryBuilder->onConfigureQuery(
    function(Builder $query, ReportDimension $dimension, array $metrics) {
        $query->leftJoin('acme_shop_categories', function($join) {
            $join->on('acme_shop_categories.id', '=', 'acme_shop_products.category_id');
        });

        $query->addSelect([
            Db::raw('max(acme_shop_products.brand) as oc_field_brand'),
            Db::raw('max(acme_shop_categories.category_name) as oc_field_category'),
        ]);
    }
);
```

It may seem odd that we use the `max` function for the product brand and category. The reason this is necessary is because the query is grouped by the product ID column (dimension), and we must use aggregation functions on all columns to avoid MySQL errors. This simple trick resolves the issue.

The dimension fields are now available for preview in the dashboard. Users can configure widgets to sort data by the brand or category column:

### Using the Data Source

A properly configured data source is immediately ready for use in all types of dashboard widgets without additional setup. For example, you can configure the Chart widget to display the top products.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/chart-widget.png)

In this example, the chart widget is set up as follows:

- Chart type: Bar
- Direction: Horizontal
- Data source: Our test data source
- Dimension: Product
- Metrics: Total amount
- Limit: 5
- Sort by: Total amount
- Sort order: Descending
- Display: Dashboard interval

You can also configure the Indicator widget to display totals, with the option to filter the data by a specific brand or category:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/indicator-widgets.png)

In this example, the Smartphones Indicator widget is set up as follows:

- Data source: Our test data source
- Dimension: Product
- Value: Total amount
- Filters attribute: Category
- Filter operation: Equals
- Value: Smartphones

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octobercms/docs/develop/images/dashboards/indicator-smartphones.png)

The iPhones Indicator widget uses the following filter configuration:

- Attribute: Product
- Operation: Includes
- Value: iPhone
